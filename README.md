# WorkoutBuilder

My Code Louisville C# ASP.NET MVC project.

A web application designed to let users crewte their own workouts.

Users can add, modify, and/or delete exercises and sets of repetitions.

Users can add name and description of workout, but at this point, cannot actually add , delete, or modify exercises within a workout.

Reviewer needs to download, compile, and run the solution from Visual Studio.
