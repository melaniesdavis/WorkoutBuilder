# WorkoutBuilder

My Code Louisville C# ASP.NET MVC project.

A web application designed to let users create their own workouts.

Users can add, modify, and/or delete exercises and sets of repetitions.

Users can create a new workout by first adding the name and a description of the workout. 

To see the details of a workout, or to add, delete, or modify exercises within a workout, user must select 
to see the "Details" of a workout.

User / Reviewer needs to download, compile, and run the solution from Visual Studio.  

This was written in Visual Studio 2015.
